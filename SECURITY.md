# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the latest release is supported. However, if you use a downstream OS distribution (e.g., Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, FreeBSD), they may patch out security bugs without following our latest releases.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report them in the [security page](https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig-core-c/security/advisories).
